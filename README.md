# Template: Vite + SCSS + JS vanilla 

## Description

- the template is more oriented towards building with pure JS, but can be rebuilt on a framework if desired.
- suitable for both single page application and multi-page application

## What's useful?

### Vite setup

- image optimisation
- componentisation with HTML
- auto-update on html changes
- added aliases for convenience

### Styles

#### Organisation of styles

- the necessary files for the styles are organised in the appropriate folders
- Each abstract folder subfolder has a common build file (it is without underscore)
- global.scss - styles from the previous item are collected into the file. 

it's global styles. you just need it to import into each style file with these: 
`@use '@styles/global' as *;`

- you can import mixins, variables, etc into components also locally

#### Using abilities of SCSS

- variables: screen size, font size, colours, etc.
- mixins:
	- breakpoint (mobile-first prefer)  with/without px-to-rem convertation (you also can use px-to-rem function separately if you want)
	- counting average tablet values if you have only for mobile and desktop (works correctly with px)
 
 how to use mixins you can find into instruction.scss into styles folder

#### What about the layout?

- it have three main components: 
	- header
	- main
	- footer
- parent of these (body) has grid-layout
- all of these three has 100% width of  body. you need to use paddings/margins with containers to get desired result
- BEM methodology
